    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Faculty Workload Optimization System:<br />
                This project involved designing and developing a system to optimize faculty workload allocation. I
                leveraged my Python and SQL skills to analyze historical workload data and identify patterns. I then
                implemented machine learning algorithms to predict future workload needs and recommend optimal
                course assignments. This project improved faculty satisfaction and course scheduling efficiency. </li>
            <li>Tender Management System:<br />
                Developed and implemented a Tender Management System (TMS) to streamline the tendering
                process, resulting in a 20% reduction in processing time. Leveraged Python and Django to create a
                user-friendly interface for managing tenders, automating workflows, and generating reports.
                Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements, design the system, and ensure its successful
                integration.</li>
